## Inspiration
Goods and materials that are often thrown out still hold value and can be put to good use. Our website aims to encourage users to reuse and offer goods that would otherwise be dumped in landfills where they deteriorate and pollute.

## What it does
ReMake! Bring new life to old goods
ReMake is a waste and sustainability initiative website that lets users buy and sell old goods that would have otherwise gone to waste and landfill. Whether it's for art, design sustainability, or another project. ReMake will have what you need.

## How we built it
ReMake is developed, supported, and powered by the following technologies. The core website was developed with React, with the visual aspects created with Material UI and server hosting and backend supported by Firebase and Google Storage Bucket.

## Challenges we ran into
Storing and retrieving images was a fair challenge that we had to overcome. The main problem was the fact that retrieving images often takes much longer than retrieving the content of a listing, especially without a cache service or a CDN. To make the experience as smooth as possible, we utilized states to minimize any impact of the delay.

Designing and implementing an intuitive user experience was another massive challenge. We had to look at other e-commerce websites and also think about the changes we need to make and the unique features we need to implement, in order to better fit our purpose. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We designed, developed and tested a robust product within a relatively short span of time. 

## What we learned
Market research and designing a user-centered experience. 

Image storage and retrieval.

## What's next for ReMake
There are multiple opportunities and areas for ReMake to expand such as discussion forums and DIY guides. The discussion forum is aimed to encourage our users to share and discuss their ideas, or just to browse for inspiration. Additionally, the DIY guide aims to support the Remake ideals with a platform to share user-created DIY projects and guides.
